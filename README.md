# Team Pepega - Project Proposal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-lg1Ho9gU&feature=youtu.be
## Project Title

- Magic Video

## Team Members

- Botao Martin
- Harrison
- Qi

## Description of the web application

- This web application is used for in-browser video editing, and allows users to upload and download the edited video. Note: We are thinking about adding the idea of user account to this platform and allowing users to share their video with others.

## Description of the key features that will be completed by the Beta version

- Video captioning
- Splicing multiple videos together
- Able to trim a part of the video
- Adding audio files & images to videos
- Basic Transition effects (e.g. Fade In, Fade Out)

## Description of additional features that will be complete by the Final version

- Preview of the edited video
- Able to add your voice into the video (via the user’s microphone)
- Users can get help using from the “User Guide” section

## Description of the technology that we will use

- MongoDB
- ExpressJS
- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- Deploy on Heroku
- This is the JavaScript library that we mainly used for video editing:
  - https://github.com/fluent-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg

## Description of the top 5 technical challenges

- **Data Structure Design**: Data structure for the video edit package (store all the current edit action and status of different video/sound-track source)
- **Integration**: We need to seamlessly integrate multiple JavaScript libraries together, since there isn’t one library that can handle all our video editing needs
- **User Interface**: Since we are using JavaScript libraries for the “backend”, we would need a more complex front-end to simulate the desired video editing software.
- **Optimizing Render/Editing Performance**: Video editing takes a long time to compile normally. Depending on the JavaScript libraries that we use, our web app may have performance issues that we need to address.
- **Minimizing Response Time**: Since this is a very interactive web, we want to ensure a smooth user experience. We will need to use the idea of async and sync effectively to minimize the response time.

# Instructions

1. npm run install-all

# Run

To run, Type the following in the terminal:
